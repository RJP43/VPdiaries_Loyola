[1909-01-xx]	[indent] There has been a feeling that
	since [person] Father Schulak's [/person] departure
	two or three years ago, perhaps
	we are not taking proper care
	of the Museums he collected at
	some [BM: 2017-10-28: note: (strikethrough me in "some")]  much expense and trouble. We
	found that the hides of the animals
	in the [place] Natural History Museum [place]
	might be destroyed by insects &c.
	accordingly it was suggested that
	as the responsibility for caring
	for the museum was so great,
	it might be better to sell it,
	especially as we have great need of
	money at the present time for
	putting up the [place] Academy building
	in Rogers Park [/place].
	[indent] accordingly we communicated with
	[person] Mr. Skiff [/person] , the director of the
	[place] Field Museum [/place], who was very
	courteous and offered to send over
	two of his men to place a valuation
	on the museum
Feb 1 [1909-02-01]	[indent] To-day, Monday, [person] Prof. Corey [/person]
	of the Natural History department,
	and [person] Dr. Farrington [/person] of the geology
	department inspected our museum.
	[person] Dr. Farrington [/person] valued our minerals
	at $5000, including  $500 for the amethyst collection.
	[person] Prof Corey [/person] valued the mammals
	at $1700, and the birds
	at an average of one dollar
	each. No valuation was
	placed on the shells.
