<div type="entry"><lb/><label>[1909-01-xx]</label>[indent] There has been a feeling that
<lb/>since [person] Father Schulak's [/person] departure
<lb/>two or three years ago, perhaps
<lb/>we are not taking proper care
<lb/>of the Museums he collected at
<lb/>some [BM: 2017-10-28: note: (strikethrough me in "some")]  much expense and trouble. We
<lb/>found that the hides of the animals
<lb/>in the [place] Natural History Museum [place]
<lb/>might be destroyed by insects &amp;c.
<lb/>accordingly it was suggested that
<lb/>as the responsibility for caring
<lb/>for the museum was so great,
<lb/>it might be better to sell it,
<lb/>especially as we have great need of
<lb/>money at the present time for
<lb/>putting up the [place] Academy building
<lb/>in Rogers Park [/place].
<lb/>[indent] accordingly we communicated with
<lb/>[person] Mr. Skiff [/person] , the director of the
<lb/>[place] Field Museum [/place], who was very
<lb/>courteous and offered to send over
<lb/>two of his men to place a valuation
<lb/>on the museum

<lb/>of the Natural History department,
<lb/>and [person] Dr. Farrington [/person] of the geology
<lb/>department inspected our museum.
<lb/>[person] Dr. Farrington [/person] valued our minerals
<lb/>at $5000, including  $500 for the amethyst collection.
<lb/>[person] Prof Corey [/person] valued the mammals
<lb/>at $1700, and the birds
<lb/>at an average of one dollar
<lb/>each. No valuation was
<lb/>placed on the shells.
