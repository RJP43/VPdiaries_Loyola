            <br />since Father Schulak's departure
            <br />two or three years ago, perhaps
            <br />we are not taking proper care
            <br />of the Museums he collected at
            <br />so<del>me</del>  much expense and trouble. We
            <br />found that the hides of the animals
            <br />in the Natural History Museum
            <br />might be destroyed by insects &amp;c.
            <br />accordingly it was suggested that
            <br />as the responsibility for caring
            <br />for the museum was so great,
            <br />it might be better to sell it,
            <br />especially as we have great need of
            <br />money at the present time for
            <br />putting up the Academy building
            <br />in Rogers Park.
            <br /><span class="indent"><pre>	</pre></span>accordingly we communicated with
            <br />Mr. Skiff, the director of the
            <br />Field Museum, who was very
            <br />courteous and offered to send over
            <br />two of his men to place a valuation
            <br />on the museum
         </p>
         <p class="entry"><br /><span class="entryLabel">Feb 1 <span class="date" title="1909-02-01">*</span></span><span class="indent"><pre>	</pre></span>To-day, Monday, Prof. Corey
            <br />of the Natural History department,
            <br />and Dr. Farrington of the geology
            <br />department inspected our museum.
            <br />Dr. Farrington valued our minerals
            <br />at $5000, including  $500 for the amethyst collection.
            <br />Prof Corey valued the mammals
            <br />at $1700, and the birds
            <br />at an average of one dollar
            <br />each. No valuation was
            <br />placed on the shells.
