<p>since [person] Father Schulak's [/person] departure</p>
<p>two or three years ago, perhaps</p>
<p>we are not taking proper care</p>
<p>of the Museums he collected at</p>
<p>some [BM: 2017-10-28: note: (strikethrough me in "some")]  much expense and trouble. We</p>
<p>found that the hides of the animals</p>
<p>in the [place] Natural History Museum [/place]</p>
<p>might be destroyed by insects &amp;c.</p>
<p>accordingly it was suggested that</p>
<p>as the responsibility for caring</p>
<p>for the museum was so great,</p>
<p>it might be better to sell it,</p>
<p>especially as we have great need of</p>
<p>money at the present time for</p>
<p>putting up the [place] Academy building</p>
<p>in Rogers Park [/place].</p>
<p><hi rend="indent"/>accordingly we communicated with</p>
<p>[person] Mr. Skiff [/person] , the director of the</p>
<p>[place] Field Museum [/place], who was very</p>
<p>courteous and offered to send over</p>
<p>two of his men to place a valuation</p>
<p>on the museum</p>

<p>of the Natural History department,</p>
<p>and [person] Dr. Farrington [/person] of the geology</p>
<p>department inspected our museum.</p>
<p>[person] Dr. Farrington [/person] valued our minerals</p>
<p>at $5000, including  $500 for the amethyst collection.</p>
<p>[person] Prof Corey [/person] valued the mammals</p>
<p>at $1700, and the birds</p>
<p>at an average of one dollar</p>
<p>each. No valuation was</p>
<p>placed on the shells.</p>
